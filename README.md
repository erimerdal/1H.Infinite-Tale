# Game Description

Infinite Tale is a turn based strategy game which will be written in Java

# Objective
* Objective is to spread your empire as much as possible in the given turn limit by making wise decisions and trusting your senses.
* Also another mode in the game will have no time limit so you theoretically conquer all the world, so take your time.

# Time
* Game is taking place in the Middle Ages and in a Feudal World.
* In game time will be turn-based.
* A turn will denote a specific time period which you collect your taxes from your villagers, or move a block of continent when attacking. Also it will be the minimum time limit for using the merchant.

# General Information
* Game will be played on a hexagon map where each faction is shown with a different color
* You can choose a faction like Vikings, British Empire or Ottoman for a taste of different cultures. Of course these factions will have different bonuses against each other. For an example, Vikings will have advantage over others when battleground takes place near a sea. Or Ottoman Empire will have Janissaries taking place of normal archers, since they have gunpowder and archers do not, they will be in an advantageous position.
* There is a little bit of luck involved in wars to spice things up, like every unit will have a little chance of critical hits, which will correspond to two normal hit damage. This can mean even if you have a smaller army you always will have a chance to win.
* Some troops will have advantage over other groups, like cavalry will have advantage over trebuchets since they are fast. A smart counter-design of enemy units might win you the war easier than you think.
* There will be a Merchant where you can buy tactical equipment with the gold you have. Such as leather armour or iron armour which will give extra protection points for your units, or shields that will give resistance to your troops from enemy archers, etc.
* Gold is earned by conquering other places and collecting taxes from your villagers. If you have more land, this will obviously mean that you will have more villagers, resulting in more gold to create troops or buy equipment.
* AI controlled factions. They will act with turns just like you, they may decide to conquer you too. 

# In Thought Process
* Technology tree
* Terrain and weather based bonuses
* Different music will be played in different situations, we hope you can find your taste in-game.
* Villagers will have a happiness level, which might result in riots in specific lands if you collect many tax. You might be able to give feasts or wine to increase their happiness.
* Saving the game so you may continue from where you left.
